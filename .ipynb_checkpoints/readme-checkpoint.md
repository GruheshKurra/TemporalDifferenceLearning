## 🎮 Quick Start

```python
from td_learning import TDLearningEnvironment, TDLearningAgent

# Create environment and agent
env = TDLearningEnvironment(num_states=5)

```

## 📊 What You'll See

### Value Function Learning
The agent learns that states closer to the terminal reward have higher values:
- **State 0**: 2.42 (starting point)
- **State 1**: 4.85 (getting better)
- **State 2**: 6.91 (good position) 
- **State 3**: 8.67 (almost at goal)
- **State 4**: 0.00 (terminal state)

### Training Progression
- **Episodes 1-20**: Large TD errors (2.0+) as agent explores
- **Episodes 20-60**: Moderate errors (1.5-2.0) as values stabilize
- **Episodes 60+**: Small errors (<1.5) showing convergence

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Parameters
- `num_states`: Number of states in the environment (default: 5)
- `terminal_state`: Goal state that provides reward (default: 4)

### Agent Parameters
- `alpha`: Learning rate (0.1) - how fast to update values
- `gamma`: Discount factor (0.9) - importance of future rewards
- `num_episodes`: Training episodes (100)

### Reward Structure
- `+10`: Reaching terminal state
- `-1`: Wrong action
- `0`: Correct move toward goal

## 📈 Output Files

### Automatic Saves
- `td_learning_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Complete training data

### JSON Structure
```json

  "parameters": {
    "alpha": 0.1,
    "gamma": 0.9,

```

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### TD(0) Update Rule
```
V(s) ← V(s) + α[r + γV(s') - V(s)]
```

Where:
- `V(s)`: Current state value estimate
- `α`: Learning rate
- `r`: Immediate reward
- `γ`: Discount factor
- `V(s')`: Next state value estimate

### Key Concepts
- **Bootstrapping**: Using current estimates to improve future estimates
- **Online Learning**: Updates happen immediately after each experience
- **Temporal Difference**: Learning from the difference between predictions

## 🔬 Experiments

### Hyperparameter Testing
```python
# Test different learning rates
for alpha in [0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]:
    agent = TDLearningAgent(num_states=5, alpha=alpha, gamma=0.9)
    agent.train(env, num_episodes=100)
```

### Environment Variations
```python
# Test different environment sizes
for num_states in [3, 5, 10, 20]:
    env = TDLearningEnvironment(num_states=num_states)
    agent = TDLearningAgent(num_states=num_states)
    agent.train(env, num_episodes=200)
```

## 📚 Educational Use

Perfect for:
- **RL Course Assignments** - Clear, well-documented implementation
- **Research Baseline** - Solid foundation for TD learning experiments  
- **Concept Demonstration** - Visual learning of value function convergence
- **Algorithm Comparison** - Benchmark against other RL methods

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Values not converging**: Check learning rate (try α=0.1)
- **Oscillating values**: Learning rate too high (reduce α)
- **Slow learning**: Learning rate too low (increase α) or more episodes needed
- **Import errors**: Install required packages with pip

### Performance Tips
- **Faster convergence**: Increase learning rate (α) but watch for instability
- **Better exploration**: Implement ε-greedy action selection
- **Larger environments**: Increase episode count proportionally

# Understanding Temporal Difference Learning: Learning to Predict the Future

*How AI agents learn to estimate value using incomplete information*

## The Problem: Learning Without Complete Information

Imagine you're exploring a new city and trying to figure out which neighborhoods are "good" to be in. Traditional approaches might require you to complete entire walking tours before updating your opinions. But what if you could learn immediately from each step?

That's exactly what Temporal Difference (TD) Learning does for AI agents.

## What Makes TD Learning Special?

Unlike Monte Carlo methods that wait for complete episodes, TD learning updates its beliefs **immediately** after each experience. It's like updating your restaurant ratings after each meal, rather than waiting until you've tried every dish.

### The Magic Formula

V(s) ← V(s) + α[r + γV(s') - V(s)]

This simple equation captures profound learning:
- **V(s)**: "How good do I think this state is?"
- **r + γV(s')**: "What did I just learn about this state?"
- **α**: "How much should I trust this new information?"

## Seeing TD Learning in Action

I implemented a complete TD learning system and watched it learn. Here's what happened:

### Episode 1: First Discoveries
```
Initial values: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
After episode:  [-0.09, 0.0, -0.09, 1.0, 0.0]
```

The agent discovered that state 3 leads to a +10 reward and immediately updated its value!

### Episode 20: Information Spreads
```
Values: [1.57, 4.27, 6.11, 8.88, 0.0]
```

Like ripples in a pond, the value information propagated backwards. States closer to the reward became more valuable.

### Episode 100: Convergence
```
Final values: [2.42, 4.85, 6.91, 8.67, 0.0]
```

Perfect! The agent learned that each state's value reflects its distance from the goal.

## Why This Matters

TD learning is everywhere in modern AI:
- **Game AI**: Learning chess positions without playing complete games
- **Recommendation Systems**: Updating preferences from immediate feedback
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Learning road conditions from each sensor reading
- **Financial Trading**: Adjusting strategies from each market tick

## Key Insights from Implementation

### 1. Bootstrap Learning Works
The agent successfully learned by using its own imperfect estimates. Like a student who gets better by checking their work against their current best understanding.

### 2. Gradual Convergence
TD errors started large (2.0+) and gradually decreased (1.4-), showing the algorithm naturally converging to correct values.

### 3. Online Learning is Powerful
No waiting for complete episodes meant faster adaptation and more efficient learning.

## The Bigger Picture

TD learning represents a fundamental shift in how we think about learning:
- **From batch to online**: Learn from each experience immediately
- **From certainty to estimation**: Use best current guesses to improve
- **From complete to incremental**: Make progress with partial information

This mirrors how humans actually learn - we don't wait for complete life experiences before updating our beliefs about the world.

## Try It Yourself

The complete implementation is available on GitHub with detailed logging so you can watch every step of the learning process. It's fascinating to see an algorithm bootstrap itself to knowledge!

```python
# Watch TD learning in action
agent = TDLearningAgent(alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9)
agent.train(env, num_episodes=100)
agent.visualize_training()
```

## What's Next?

This simple TD implementation opens doors to:
- **Q-Learning**: Learning optimal actions, not just state values
- **Deep TD Networks**: Using neural networks for complex state spaces
- **Actor-Critic Methods**: Combining TD learning with policy optimization

TD learning isn't just an algorithm - it's a philosophy of learning from incomplete information, which might be the most human thing about artificial intelligence.
